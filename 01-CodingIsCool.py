# I started by declaring the necessary variables.
word1 = ('Coding ')
word2 = ('is ')
word3 = ('Cool')

# Then I followed the appropriate procedure for concatonating strings together.
print(word1 + word2 + word3)

# After running the code, the words "Coding is Cool" should be printed onto the console.
