# I start by declaring the values a and b, before then initialising them with the corresponding values provided in the instructions.

a = 8
b = 10

# Then I declare the third value as being the sum of a and b.

c = (a + b)

# After that, I'll make the value of c be printed on the console through:

print(c)

#Running the code should print the sum of the operation.
